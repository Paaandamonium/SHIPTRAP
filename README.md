# SHIPTRAP
SHIPTRAP code and data
The frequency scans with the format

cyclotron_cooling_time -> cyclotron_centering_amp_"freq_scan" -> "fwhm" -> gas_flow

are the files that the ipynb file reads, but you can group them all together somewhere because the others are not accessed
in the ipynb you'll need to change the line to wherever the data is stored
